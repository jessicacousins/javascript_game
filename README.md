# Whack-a-Mole JavaScript Game

## Description:

This simple game is a web-based version of the classic arcade game Whack-a-Mole. Players are able to 'whack' moles appearing in holes on the screen. A count down clock displays the time left in the game. There is also a score board that displays the current score of the player. The background and mole images were uniquely created using ChatGPT-4. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to develop the game.

## How to Play:

- Click on the 'Start Game' button to begin.
- A mole will appear at random in the holes on the grid.
- Click on the mole as it appears to earn points.
- The game tracks the time left and the score.
